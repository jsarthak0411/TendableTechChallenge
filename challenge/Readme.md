# Tendable Tech Challenge

This document is intended to create an understanding of how the project has been structured and how it can be executed.

## Description

The project has been created using Selenium with Java.

## Structure of the project 
A Maven project is created.
Dependencies are added for Selenium, TestNG, WebDriver Manager and Extent Reports.
Test file 'AppTest.java' is created under src/test/java.
3 Test cases are created - one each for Tasks 1-3.
TestNG annotations have been used.
Setup and Teardown functions are created with the intention of not repeating the same set of code under every test case.
Assertions are put in place to check the test cases are on the pages where they are expected to be at all times.

## How to execute the project
Right click on test file 'AppTest.java' and select 'Run As > TestNG Test'
